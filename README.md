# bitcoin-price-prediction-using-10-fold-cross-validation

Cryptocurrencies are the future in E-commerce. But with increasing number of currencies available in
the market it is mandatory to keep track of their growth so as to maximise our profits in the investment
in the same. Thus price prediction of these cryptos is very much necessary. Even if it does varies like
stock market shares it is very much different from the latter. Being different in terms of dependent and
affecting factors we need to develop new models for accurate and fast predictions of the
cryptocurrency. And what can be better than the deep learning algorithms itself, thus this project works
on the same.
